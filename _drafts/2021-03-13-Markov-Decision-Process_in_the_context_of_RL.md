> Markov decision process (MDP) is a <span style="color:red">discrete-time</span> <span style="color:green">stochastic</span> control process, which is very useful in the robotic application especially when uncertainty should be modeled in the process. This post include Monte Carlo method, Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) and Markov decision process. Then short mathmatical application shall be discussed in later in SLAM section and RL section. What need to mentioned is that Markov methods are not only useful in Reinforcement Learning but also in SLAM.
